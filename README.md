# Introduction
The Autonomous Wheelchair project leverages the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a high-performance, low-power AI platform, to process sensor data, perform real-time object detection, and make intelligent decisions for autonomous navigation. The project integrates a range of sensors, including depth sensors, LiDAR, and cameras, to perceive the environment and provide accurate obstacle detection and avoidance capabilities.

The wheelchair's autonomous navigation system is built upon a combination of perception, path planning, and control algorithms. Deep Learning models are employed for object recognition and localization, allowing the wheelchair to detect obstacles and create a dynamic map of the surrounding environment.
